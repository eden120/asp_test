# Technical Test - Software Engineer - ASP.Net MVC

## General Description

Create a simple TAX calculator using [ASP.NET MVC](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/mvc)

For reference, Gross Amount is calculated as follows:

`[Net Amount] * (1 + ([TaxRate] / 100)`

- Use Bootstrap in your views to make it responsive.
- Use async await as you see fit.
- We use MSTest and [Moq](http://code.google.com/p/moq) at Applicita, references have been added using [NuGet](http://nuget.codeplex.com/) Packages. Everything is in place for you to just write the code (no "File > New Project" required).
- Please DO NOT fork this project on Github, as we want to be sure candidates' test submissions are original.

## Task requirements

- All stories to be completed with an appropriate level of testing.
- No actual database implementation is required, feel free to stub it out.
- Your code should trend towards being SOLID.
- Please download the [code](https://github.com/Applicita/Test-Software-Engineer-AspNetMVC), complete the tasks as you see fit.
- Send us a Dropbox/Skydrive/whatever link to your zipped code to info@applicita.com or attach a zip file directly to the email.
- Please don't spend too long on this test; 120 minutes at most.

## Extra Credit
